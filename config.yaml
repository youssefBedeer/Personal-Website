      ## 🚀 Usage

      ### Training the Model

      Run the complete ML pipeline:

      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```

      This executes all pipeline stages:
      1. **Data Ingestion** - Downloads and extracts the dataset
      2. **Data Validation** - Validates schema and data quality
      3. **Data Transformation** - Preprocesses features and splits data

      uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
      ```

      **Streamlit Dashboard**
      ```bash
      streamlit run app.py
      ```

      **Gradio Interface**
      ```bash
      python app.py  # If using Gradio
      ```

      ### Making Predictions

      Once the API is running, send POST requests with customer data:

      ```python
      import requests

      # Example customer data
      customer_data = {
          "gender": "Female",
          "SeniorCitizen": 0,
          "Partner": "Yes",
          "Dependents": "No",
          "tenure": 12,
          "PhoneService": "Yes",
          "MultipleLines": "No",
          "InternetService": "Fiber optic",
          "OnlineSecurity": "No",
          "OnlineBackup": "Yes",
          "DeviceProtection": "No",
          "TechSupport": "No",
          "StreamingTV": "Yes",
          "StreamingMovies": "No",

          "PaymentMethod": "Electronic check",
          "MonthlyCharges": 70.35,
          "TotalCharges": "1397.475"
      }

      response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json=customer_data)
      print(response.json())
      ```

      - ✅ CORS support for web integration

      **Endpoints:**
      - `GET /` - Health check
      - `POST /predict` - Single prediction
      - `POST /predict/batch` - Batch predictions
      - `GET /model/info` - Model metadata

      **Example FastAPI Structure:**
      ```python
      from fastapi import FastAPI
      from pydantic import BaseModel

      app = FastAPI(title="Telco Churn Prediction API")

      class CustomerData(BaseModel):
          gender: str
          SeniorCitizen: int
          Partner: str
          # ... other features

      @app.post("/predict")
      async def predict_churn(customer: CustomerData):
          # Load model and make prediction
          return {"churn_probability": 0.75, "will_churn": True}
      ```

      ## ☁️ AWS Deployment

      ### Prerequisites
      1. AWS Account
      2. AWS CLI configured
      3. Docker installed

      ### Deployment Steps

      #### 1. Create IAM User
      Create an IAM user with the following policies:
      - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
      - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`

      #### 2. Create ECR Repository
      ```bash
      aws ecr create-repository --repository-name telco-churn
      ```

      Save the repository URI (e.g., `566373416292.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/telco-churn`)

      #### 3. Launch EC2 Instance
      - Choose Ubuntu AMI
      - Instance type: t2.medium or larger
      - Configure security groups (open ports 22, 80, 8000)

      #### 4. Install Docker on EC2
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update -y
      sudo apt-get upgrade -y
      curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
      sudo sh get-docker.sh
      sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
      newgrp docker
      ```

      #### 5. Configure GitHub Secrets
      Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
      - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
      - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
      - `AWS_REGION` (e.g., `us-east-1`)
      - `AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI` (e.g., `566373416292.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`)
      - `ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME` (e.g., `telco-churn`)

      #### 6. Setup Self-Hosted Runner
      In GitHub repository:
      1. Go to Settings → Actions → Runners
      2. Click "New self-hosted runner"
      3. Follow instructions to configure on EC2

      #### 7. Deploy via GitHub Actions
      Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment:
      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```

      ## ⚙️ Configuration

      ### config.yaml
      Main configuration file for pipeline stages:
      ```yaml
      artifacts_root: artifacts

      data_ingestion:
        root_dir: artifacts/data_ingestion
        source_url: <data_source_url>
        
      model_trainer:
        root_dir: artifacts/model_trainer
        THRESHOLD: 0.30  # Classification threshold
      ```

      ### params.yaml
      Hyperparameter search space for Optuna:
      ```yaml
      xgboost_params:
        n_estimators:
          type: int
          low: 300
          high: 800
        learning_rate:
          type: float
          low: 0.01
          high: 0.2
        max_depth:
          type: int
          low: 3
          high: 10
      ```

      ### schema.yaml
      Data schema validation:
      ```yaml
      COLUMNS:
        gender: object
        SeniorCitizen: int64
        tenure: int64
        MonthlyCharges: float64
        Churn: object

      TARGET_COLUMN:
        name: Churn
      ```

      ---

      ## 🔍 Model Performance

      The model is optimized using Optuna with the following metrics:
      - **Accuracy**: Overall prediction accuracy
      - **Precision**: Precision for churn class
      - **Recall**: Recall for churn class
      - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
      - **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve
      - **Log Loss**: Logarithmic loss

      Custom threshold (default: 0.30) is used to optimize for business objectives.

      ## 🧪 Testing

      Run tests (when implemented):
      ```bash
      pytest tests/
      ```

      ---

      ## 📝 Development Workflow

      1. **Update Configuration**: Modify `config.yaml`, `schema.yaml`, `params.yaml`
      2. **Update Entities**: Define data classes in `src/entity/`
      3. **Update Config Manager**: Modify `src/config/configuration.py`
      4. **Update Components**: Implement logic in `src/components/`
      5. **Update Pipelines**: Create pipeline stages in `src/pipeline/`
      6. **Update Main**: Integrate stages in `main.py`
      7. **Update App**: Add API endpoints in `app.py`
