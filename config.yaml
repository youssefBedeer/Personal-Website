projects:
- name: Telco Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML System
  tagline: Production-Level ML Pipeline with Modular Architecture
  description: |
    • Built a production-level ML pipeline with modular parts for data ingestion, schema validation, feature engineering, and model training, following best practices in software engineering.
    • Optimised an XGBoost classifier using Optuna’s Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm for Bayesian hyperparameter tuning of nine hyperparameters, systematically improving model metrics.
    • Created a thorough data preprocessing pipeline with scikit-learn transformers, handling categorical encoding (one-hot, label), numerical scaling (StandardScaler), and missing value imputation for robust feature engineering.
  tech_stack:
  - Python
  - XGBoost
  - Optuna
  - Scikit-learn
  - FastAPI

- name: End-to-End Plant Disease Detection System
  tagline: CV Pipeline with Transfer Learning & MLOps
  description: |
    • Developed an end-to-end CV pipeline classifying 15 plant disease categories from leaf images using VGG16 (ImageNet pre-trained) transfer learning.
    • Built a production-ready ML stack with DVC (data versioning + pipelines), MLflow (tracking + registry), and Dagshub (reproducibility) to enable smooth model promotion to production.
    • Deployed a full-stack solution with FastAPI for real-time inference and Streamlit for user-friendly predictions, enabling users to upload images and receive instant diagnoses.
