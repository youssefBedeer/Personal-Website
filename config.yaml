- name: Telco Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML System
  tagline: RAG-based assistant for customer support teams
  description: 'Designed and deployed an end-to-end ML system covering 5 core stages
    (ingestion, validation, feature engineering, training, deployment) to support
    proactive customer retention strategies. Implemented MLOps workflows using MLflow
    to track multiple experiment runs and model versions, improving reproducibility
    and comparison across iterations. Deployed a containerized REST API using FastAPI
    and Docker, integrated with AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines to enable reliable,
    repeatable production releases.
